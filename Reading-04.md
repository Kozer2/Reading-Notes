**JS&JQuery Book**  

***Chapter 3***  
- An important part of webpages is using functions to perform tasks. Functions are groups of scripts that are run each time the function is called.
  - It is easy to create a function, you do so by declaring the function and giving it a name. For example: function countTo100(){}
    - In that example I declare the function by typing out 'function'. I then give it a name, in this case 'countTo100' and end it by giving it () and {}. If the function takes an arguement, it goes in the paranthesis
 - Functions can do many things, it is up to you to determine what you want your function to do.
