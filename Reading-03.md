### Reading 3

**HTML&CSS Book**

***Chapter 3***  
We talked about lists in this chapter
There are:
          - Ordered Lists
            - These lists use numbers and are like step by step instructions to be followed
          - Unordered lists
            - These lists are ways to order information as you see fit. Sort of like the list I created here. Listception
          - Definition List
            - Used to give terms and then the meaning for those terms. 
          - Nested Lists
            - You can nest lists inside another. Again like what I did here creating these lists. 
            
***Chapter 13***  
You can create boxes around items on your webpage. You canm give it things like a bigger border, more padding, a smaller margin.
- With enough determination you can give them rounded edges. 
  - border-top-left-radius: 80px 50px; would give you a rounded top left corner. 
  
  
  
  
 **JS&JQUERY Book**  
 
***Chapter 2***  
- Arrays are numbered starting at 0. 
- An array of 5 items would look like: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 


***Chapter 4***  
You can use switch statements to change what a user sees in, for example, a message, depending on what othert variable they have. 
Create counters for your loops! Create a counter variable and using code like counter++ add 1 to the counter. Or take away from it!
