# Intro to Hash tables

*Terms*  
Hash: The result of an algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value.  
Buckets: What is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable.  
Collisions: What happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the table

We use Hashtables because they can hold unique values, they let us use dictionaries, and they are libraries. 

Hash maps store values by:
1. Accepting a key
2. calculating the hash of the key
3. using modules to convert that hash into an index in an array
4. storing the key with that value


# Basics of Hash tables

Hashing turns large keys into smaller key by using *hash functions*. They store the values in a *hash table*
