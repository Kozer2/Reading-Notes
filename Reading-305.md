# Heroku

Heroku is a service that supports multiple programming languages. It is used by people and developers to develop apps for the modern workforce. It offers a way for people to get their apps out there for people to see them. 

But you may be wondering, how do I install this service? 
Simple! Go to this website: [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up) and install for Mac or Windows. 
Or if you have Ubuntu, use one of these commands: sudo snap install heroku --classic or if that doesn't work use: curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh

Once that is done there is a simple and easy to follow guide on setting it up further. You'll need to create an account.
