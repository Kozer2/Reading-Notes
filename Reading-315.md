# When Women Stopped Coding

In 1984 the amount of women in programming peaked,and then tanked. 
What happened? Well around that time home computers became more accessible. But were mostly marketed to boys and men. 
- It eventually got to the point where professors figured their students had grown up with computers. For some women who did not, this made taking programming classes harder.

# Diversity in Tech
- Tech is dominated by men. White males make up 61% of all tech jobs. 
- - Men make up 73% of all Fortune 500 CEOs and 80% of Congress. 

# Why Diversity matters
- Diverse teams perform better. 
- - If you only have men on your teams, they will only develop things that are useful to them. IE they may not make the best product for women. 
- - The seatbelt was orginally developed and tested for men. This lead to more deaths for women using them until it was figured out why and changes were made.
