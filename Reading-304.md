# Regex

Regex stands for Regular Expressions. What are these? These are expressions that can very efficently extract text from different texts. Such as word docs or PDFs or webpages. 
- Regex syntax is close to the same in many different languages. Learn it for one and you know it for most!
- Regex is great for data scraping. That is grabbing data from sources. 
- Regex can replace strings in documents with others. 

While Regex has many shortcuts and shorthands. Cheat sheets are useful. Such as this one: [Cheatsheet for Regex](https://regexr.com/). 

When using regular expressions, you sometimes may want to match a special character such as $. But these have special uses and so you need to use a backspace to match them. \$ 


# CSS Grids

Using CSS Grid layouts, you can get around many issues that crop up using display: inline and floats. Grid goes very well with flexbox. 
Remember:
- a Grid container is the parents of all objects in the container. 
- a Grid item is the child of the container. 
- a Grid line is the line that divides the layout into grids. 
- a Grid cell is the location items take up.
