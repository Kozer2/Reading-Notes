# Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the three primary characteristics of Object Oriented Programming.   
You can have 1 main class that has multiple sub classes. Each of these classes would relate back to the main class but not to each other.  

**Interface**
- An interface is a reference type that defines a set of members. All classes inside that interface must implement those sets of numbers. 


# Abstract  

The keyword ```abstract``` lets you create classes that are incomplete and need a derived class.   
The keyword ```sealed``` lets you prevent inheritance of a class that were marked virtual.  


# Polymorphism  

Polymorphism is another primary characteristic of OOP.  
It is used at run time where a derived class may be trated as an object of a base class. When this happens, the objects declared type is no longer identical to what it was at run time. 


Polymorphism has virtual members
- They have properties inherited from their derived class
- The derived class may override virtual members in the base class, giving them new behavior. 


# Object Oriented Programming

Has 4 main properties
1. Abstraction
  - means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object
2. Encapsulation
  - means hiding the unnecessary details from type consumers. 
3. Inheritance
  - describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class
4. Polymorphism
  - means that you can have multiple classes taht can be used interchangeably.
