#LINQ

LINQ stands for *Language Integrated Query*.  

LINQ turns queries into first class language construct. Like Classes or methods. 

A Query is an expression that allows you to retrieve data from a source. There are 3 parts to a query. 
1. Obtain the data source
2. Create the query
3. Execute the query


Queries need to iterate over the elements of their source. They do this by use of ForEach. 

They can be told to immediatly do this by use of a ToList or ToArray


In C# you need to designate a data source. 
 This is sued by the word ```from``` 
 
 
 Create queries like an SQL query and then execute them using forEach statements.
