- Flexible media allows you to change different media on your page to size up or down as needed as you go along. 



## Floats
- A float allows content on a page to 'flow' around it on the left or right. 
- A box that is floated left will have text or other content on its right side, and vice versa for a box that is floated right. 
- Floats can be ignored or cleared by using the css "clear: both;" method.
