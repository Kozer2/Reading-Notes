What is a **Mustache?**
- a mustache is a logic-less template. 
  - it is used for HTML, configs, and source code. 
  - It is logic-less because it uses no logic. No if. No ands. No buts about it. 
  - It only uses tags. 


## Guide to Flexbox

A Container is the parent for properties. Which are the children. 
- if you put a display on a container, that applies to all its children. 
- using flex-wrap you can align items on 1 row, or multiple rows, top to bottom, bottom to top. 

Using justify content you can have the flex align:
- to the left with flex-start
- to the right with flex-end
- in the center with center
- with spaces with space-around
- and with even spaces with space-evenly


Flex also allows you to align the items inside the container using align-items. 
Its commands are: flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline. 

Children in the container can be given properties. 
One of these is flex-grow. 
- the default is 1, which spreads them out evenly. But you can apply higher numbers to children to make those individual children take more space. 

The same for grow is true to flex-shrink.
