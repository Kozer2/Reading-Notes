# Node.js. 

You **might** be asking yourself, "What is Node.js? Is it hard? Can I use it?" And # I 
am here to tell you No and Yes!

- Node.js is an open source engine that is based on Chrome and other browsers like it. But it doesn't run in the browser. 
- Installing Node is easy, you can do it in Ubuntu or direct download. 

Node.js is compatible with JavaScript and many other languages.

Did you know that Node comes with Npm? Well you do now! Its bundled with Npm which is one of the largest software registries in the world. 
- To install a package from Npm you use a command such as:  npm install -g jshint

Now to the big question. What will you use Node.js for?
- Node allows us to run JS on a server. Node was the first tool which gained traction doing this. Though not the first to do it. 
- Node is useful for apps that need real time interaction. Such as live chats! Like Slack.
