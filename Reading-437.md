### Google and AI

This article talks about how Google cancelled its DoD contract due to employee concerns about the AI being used to hurt humans. While the project was supposed to be to help 
people by identifying objects from drone footage, many employees thought otherwise. Google ended up caving to its employees and is no longer working on AI for military use, which is 
a great thing.   
I fully agree with the outcome of this article, asI don't think AI should be used for such massive surveillance has great potential to be used to harm others. AI should be used for the
benefit of all, and the last thing we need is a Marvel Helicarrier scenario happening for real.

### Cybersecurity risk of Self Driving Cars

This article is from 2017 and details the potential risks of self driving cars. In it, people demonstrated the ability to hack cars in various ways, and it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine
that some bad person somewhere could hack a car and cause a massive accident.  
I once again agree with the article that careful need needs to be taken care for self driving cars, as the potential for harm could greatly outweigh the good it could cause. As of right now
Tesla has the ability to downgrade packages on their cars and even shut them off, what is stopped a hacker from doing far worse? We need to procede with caution and ensure that there are 
proper regulations for self driving cars in the future.
