# Http Cookies Explained 

The cookie came about in 1994 from Lou Montulli, before he had the idea the only way to save state and for a server to tell which request came from which browser you would manually enter a string or a hidden form would have a token the browser would read. 

Cookies are made up of multiple different parts, each is seperated by a semi-colon and tells the server some piece of information. 

The first piece is the expires option which tells the server when the cookie expires. 
The next is the domain option which tells it whhat domains for which the cookie should be sent.  
The next is the path option, which tells what URL the cookie uses in the header.  
And finally the secure option. If a cookie is secure it is sent over HTTPS.
