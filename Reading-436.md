Redux toolkit allows a developer to develop with an opinionated wrapper to do more with less.   
Redux Ducks is prone to circular dependency. It is a folder based approach which requires separate actions. 

Using slices in the toolkit, allows you to create actions and reducers for each slive. A big advantage of the toolkit is that it speeds up the development process and allows for better code wiritng. It solves 3 issues with Redux which are:
Configuring a store is too complicated, You need to add a lot of packages to build a large application, and redux requires too much boilerplate code

1. I feel as though this reading helped me get a better understanding of how react libraries work together. 
2. I really want to learn more about the redux toolkit and ducks, and to see it in action
3. I want to create an app using all that I read about for this reading.
