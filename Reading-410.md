# Stacks and Queues 

What is a Stack?
A stack is the data structure that is made up of nodes. 

Terms when talking Stacks
- Push - Push data to the node
- Pop - Remove nodes from the stack
- Top - The top of the stack
- Peek - Looking at the top nodes value
- IsEmpty - Will return true if the stack is empty

Stacks are First In Last Out or Last In First Out

When you push to a stack it has a Big O of O(1) This is the same with popping, peeking, and IsEmpty

Terms for a Queue
- Enqueue - things are added to the queue
- Dequeue - Things are removed
- Front - Front of the queue
- Rear - Rear of the queue
- Peek - See the first value in the queue
- IsEmpty - returns true if the queue is empty

Queues also follow the FIFO, LILO way of iterating.
