# Local Storage 

Before HTML 5 cookies were one of the only way to store data locally in the html. But they were limited to about 4 KB of data and slowed down all traffic. Microsoft also added some form of storage to IE but that was limited to about 100 kb and was able to be increased to over 600.
That all changed when HTML 5 entered the field. 
With the advent of HTML 5 key value pairs can be stored locally without ever being sent to a server. 
- All data is stored as a string so you will need to use parse functions to change the data type into what you need. 
- HTML 5 offers 5 megabytes of data 
Though HTML 5 is the new standared Googles Gears is still working with SQL and if an accaptable standard is found, it may be able to compete with what HTML 5 brought.
