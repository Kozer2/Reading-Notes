# Trees
 Trees are broken up into *Binary Trees*, *Binary Search Trees*, and *K-ary Trees* among others. 
 
 Terms:
  - Node
  - Root
  - K
  - Left
  - Right
  - Edge
  - leaf
  - Height

Trees need to be transvered. Doing so allows us to find nodes. 
There are 2 ways to transverse trees. They are:  
- Depth First
- Breadth First


Death First is where we go the height of the tree. The 3 ways to do this are: 
- Pre-Order which is root -- left -- right
- In-order which is left -- root -- right
- Post-Order which is left -- right -- root


Breadth first iterates over the tree going node by node
