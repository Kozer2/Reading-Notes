# Collections

You can group objects in two ways. 
1. By making arrays of objects
2. By creating collections of objects


What do collections do?  
They provide a more flexible way to work with object groups. 
These groupings can grow or shirnk as the needs of the application change. 

Collections can be iterated over using ForEach


Kinds of collections
1. ```System.Collections.Generic Classes``` 
  - Creates generic collections
2. ```System.Collections.Concurrent classes```
  - Used when you are accessing things one after the other
3. ```System.Collections classes```
  - These do not stop elements as typed objects. They store objects as type ```Object```
  
  
  
  
 # Enumeration
 
 An **Enumeration** type is a value type that is defined by a set of named constrants
 
 They can be bit flags. These can be used to represent a combination of choices. 
 ``` System.Enum type ```
 This is the abstract base class for all enumeration types. 
 You can call this by uysing ```System.Enum``` in a base container.
