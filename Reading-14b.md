***What google learned from its quest to build the perfect team***
A study published by Harvard found that in the past 2 decades time spent in collaborative activities has grown by more than 50%
3/4ths of a normal working day for some employees is spent just talking with colleagues. 
Google put together a department to analylze how their best teams achieved the best results. They found several things one of which was that the best managers have good communication, and do not micromanage.

In 2008 a group of researchers from MIT conducted a study and they found that groups where each member spoke roughly the same amount and groups that were skilled at intuiting how others felt did the best in almost every 
task they were given. 

Google found that in general people perform better when they don't feel like they need to have a "work face" on at all times.
