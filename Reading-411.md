What is a Database Schema? 
The Schema is a grouping of objects and is accessed by using access commands

Why do we use Schemas?
Schemas are important for security purposes. They tell us who can access the database and how. They also contain the namespace preventing issues that arise when thigns are named the same. 

What is a primary key?
- A primary key is the main lookup for a database table

What is a foreign key?
- a Foreign key is used to reference other tables in a database that share a common piece of data

What is a composite key?
- The composite key makes sure that you can have multiple rows for multiple pieces of data, but that each piece of data cannot have multiple rows. 

What is a 1:1 relationship?
- a 1:1 relationship means that 1 table is only associated with 1 other table. 
- Many:Many means that many different tables have many different associates. 
- 1: Many means that 1 table has many different associates
